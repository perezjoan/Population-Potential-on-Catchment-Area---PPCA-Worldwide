This repository is part of the emc2 research project.
[emc2 project](https://emc2-dut.org/)  

# Objectives

This repository contains the implementation of the PPCA (Population Potential on Catchment Areas) protocol, a four-step procedure for acquiring, processing, and analyzing geospatial data from [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [Global Human Settlement (GHS)](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/ghs_pop2023.php) data using Python and associated libraries. The project aims to evaluate the potential number of people accessible on foot within specified proximity catchment areas. The protocol works globally by requiring only bounding box coordinates instead of sample data. The first step involves authenticating with Google Earth Engine to download GHS raster data for a specified area, converting it to vector format, and extracting and filtering OSM data for buildings, streets, and land use. The first step also calculates various morphometric indicators for buildings. The second step produces a complete classification of buildings in two categories : 1. residential or mixed-use 2. non residential. A Decision Tree Classifier is used to estimate missing values for this feature from building morphometrics. The third step determines the number of floors and the floor area for each residential or mixed-use building. Once again, a Decision Tree Classifier is used to estimate missing values from building morphometrics. The final step estimates population distribution within residential buildings based on floor area, associates these estimates with a pedestrian street network, and performs spatial analysis to map the population accessible on foot from the street network across various catchment areas. Each step outputs cleaned and processed geospatial data in the form of geopackage files, which can be used for further analysis and mapping.

# Sample Data

## STEP 1: DATA ACQUISITION - FILTERS - MORPHOMETRY [Link to code](https://github.com/perezjoan/PPCA-codes/tree/main/current%20release)

_Description:_

This script facilitates the acquisition of OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Global Human Settlement (GHS) data using Google Earth Engine, the osmnx library, and QGIS for processing. It requires the coordinates of a bounding box (WGS 84 decimal degrees) to define the geographical area. The script starts by authenticating and initializing Earth Engine to download GHS raster data for a specified year and geographical area (bounding box). The GHS data is saved on the cloud (Google Drive) as a raster image (Step 1.1), which is then manually moved to the local working directory.

Using QGIS, the raster image is converted to vector data (Step 1.2) via the pixelstopolygons algorithm and saved as a geopackage. The script proceeds to extract building, street, and land use data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for the same area. It removes non-polygon geometries, cleans up columns (removing list-type columns), and keeps only essential attributes for buildings and streets.

The script performs several filtering operations:

    - Buildings are filtered based on a minimum footprint area of 15 mÂ², removal of underground buildings, and optional filtering for buildings with no walls (Step 2.1).
    - GHS data is filtered by rounding population values and removing meshes with zero population (Step 2.2).
    - OSM streets are filtered to separate pedestrian and non-pedestrian streets by excluding streets with the following attributes: "motorway", "motorway_link", "trunk", "trunk_link", "busway" and "cycleway". Streets are also excluded if they are in tunnels (attribute "tunnel" = 'yes') or if their maxspeed is greater than or equal to 90 km/h (values 90, 100). Streets suitable for pedestrian use are then retained by ensuring they do not match these attributes or speed conditions (Step 2.3).
    - OSM land use data is filtered to exclude non-populated areas by removing polygons with the following land use categories: "construction", "cemetery", "education", "healthcare", "industrial", "military", "railway", "religious", "port", and "winter_sports". Areas that do not fall under these land use categories are considered populated (Step 2.4).

Morphometric indicators are computed for retained buildings:

    - FL for the number of floors
    - A for the surface area
    - P for perimeter
    - E for elongation
    - C for convexity
    - FA for floor area
    - ECA for a product involving elongation, convexity, and area
    - EA for an elongation-area product
    - SW for the shared walls ratio

Data are saved into two geopackages: cleaned raw data and retained features. The final output consists of filtered and cleaned vector data for GHS population, OSM buildings, streets, and land use areas. Optionally, a report with maps and statistics can be produced (Appendix 2).

## STEP 2: BUILDING CLASSIFICATION [Link to code](https://github.com/perezjoan/PPCA-codes/tree/main/current%20release)

_Description_

This script creates a 'type' column within the OSM building data with three possible values (0: Null, 1: residential or mixed-use, 2: non-residential). The initial classification is based on the 'building' attribute in OSM, where buildings such as 'apartments', 'barracks', 'house', 'residential', 'bungalow', 'cabin', 'detached', 'dormitory', 'farm', 'static_caravan', 'semidetached_house', and 'stilt_house' are classified as residential or mixed-use (1).

Next, the classification is refined through a spatial join with non-populated OSM land use areas. Buildings within non-populated areas are assigned as non-residential (2) if their 'type' is initially Null (0). The final classification statistics of buildings (classified vs Null) are printed and mapped.

The script then estimates 'type' for the remaining Null values using a Decision Tree Classifier, trained on the morphometric indicators calculated in PPCA STEP 1 (e.g., area, perimeter, elongation, convexity). The data is split into training and testing subsets based on a specified training ratio, and the classifier's accuracy is evaluated on the test set. The trained model is then used to predict the 'type' values 1 or 2 for buildings having Null value (0) in OSM.

The output includes a new variable 'type_filled', where non-null values from the original 'type' column are retained, and predicted values from the model are used to fill the previously Null entries. The script also visualizes the decision tree, maps the results, and explores how the classifier's accuracy varies with different training data sizes, plotting accuracy as a function of training size.

## STEP 3: NUMBER OF FLOORS ESTIMATION [Link to code](https://github.com/perezjoan/PPCA-codes/tree/main/current%20release)

_Description_

This script processes OSM building data by focusing exclusively on residential or mixed-use buildings (type_filled = 1). It begins by ensuring that the 'height' and 'building
' columns are numeric, converting any non-numeric entries to Null. For these residential buildings, missing 'height' values are filled by multiplying the number of floors ('building
') by 3, assuming an average floor height of 3 meters. Conversely, missing 'building
' values are filled by dividing the height by 3 and rounding the result.

The script calculates and prints the number and percentage of rows where both 'height' and 'building
' remain null. After renaming 'building
' to 'FL' (floors), it recalculates the floor-area ('FA') by multiplying the number of floors ('FL') by the building footprint ('A').

Next, the script applies a Decision Tree Classifier to predict missing 'FL' values using morphometric indicators (such as area, perimeter, elongation, and convexity) calculated in PPCA STEP 1. The data is split into training and testing sets based on a specified training ratio. The classifier is trained on the training set, and its accuracy is evaluated on the test set.

The trained model is then applied to predict missing 'FL' values in the OSM building data. The output includes a new variable named 'FL_filled', which contains the original 'FL' values for non-null entries and model predictions for null entries. Since FA (floor-area) was calculated earlier in the script, it is now modified by correcting it with the newly predicted 'FL_filled' values.

Additionally, the script visualizes the decision tree, evaluates the classifier's accuracy, and explores how accuracy varies with different proportions of training data.

## STEP 4: POPULATION POTENTIAL PER BUILDING & PER CATCHMENT AREA [Link to code](https://github.com/perezjoan/PPCA-codes/tree/main/current%20release)

_Description_

This script estimates population distribution within residential and mixed-use buildings based on floor area. Using the centroids of these buildings, it conducts a spatial join with the GHS population data to associate each building with its respective population values. The population estimates ('VALUE') are disaggregated based on the ratio of each building's floor area ('FA') to the total floor area within the same GHS population grid cell. This results in a population estimation ('Pop_estimation') for each building.

The population estimation is then integrated into a pedestrian street network analysis using cityseer. Points are generated at regular intervals along pedestrian streets, with an optional offset applied to the first point. The population potential is associated with these points within various catchment areas, which are parameterized by customizable distances. At the building level, the output variable of interest is 'Pop_estimation'. At the pedestrian network level, the output variable of interest is 'cc_Pop_estimation_sum_{catchment_area_distance}_nw'.

An optional step allows filling null values for small street segments by averaging nearby segments' population data.

## APPENDIX A1: SLOPE CALCULATION AND CLUSTERING FOR CATCHMENT AREAS [Link to code](https://github.com/perezjoan/PPCA-codes/tree/main/current%20release)

_Description_

This script processes population data calculated in STEP 4 of the PPCA protocol, focusing on analysis and clustering based on population estimates across four predefined catchment area distances. This script only works with four distances values (catchment areas calculated in STEP 4). Population values are log-transformed to ensure comparability across scales, and slopes between distances are computed for each observation. The script generates outputs to analyze population distributions and identify clusters with distinct profiles. The clustering workflow combines hierarchical clustering (to define initial cluster centers using a sample of 10,000 observations) and k-means clustering (to cluster the full dataset based on three slopes and the log-transformed population estimate at the second distance). The clustering results are validated using silhouette scores and visualized through feature curves representing the average population and slopes for each cluster. The output includes a geopackage file containing the processed dataset with slope values, clustering labels for solutions ranging from 5 to 19 clusters, and metadata for further analysis. Visualizations such as dendrograms, silhouette score plots, and feature curves allow users to interpret the clustering results and assess the distribution of population estimates across the study area.
